              1.2 The Enjoythevi Platform provides travelers with travel-related
              content, listings of various Partner Services, access to
              membership benefits, as well as travel related services provided
              by Enjoythevi. Travelers are able to, through the Enjoythevi
              Platform and Services, discover, search, plan, and reserve various
              Partner Services as well as travel-related services provided by
              Enjoythevi. However, Partners alone are responsible for their
              Listings and Services. When Travelers make or confirm bookings,
              they are entering into a contract directly with the Partner that
              listed and directly controls the Bookable they have confirmed.

              5.6 Enjoythevi may offer Partners the option of having
              professional photographers take photographs of their Partner
              Services, which are made available by the photographer to Partners

              or through the Enjoythevi Platform if they no longer accurately
              represent your Listing, if you stop Partnering the Partner Service
              featured, or if your Enjoythevi Account is terminated or suspended
              for any reason. You acknowledge and agree that Enjoythevi shall
              have the right to use any Verified Images in accordance with

              Listing or otherwise, without further notice or compensation to
              you. Where Enjoythevi is not the exclusive owner of Verified
              Images, by using such Verified Images on or through the Enjoythevi
              Platform, you grant to Enjoythevi an exclusive, worldwide,

              to you. Enjoythevi in turn grants you a limited, non-exclusive,

              restrictions (such as house rules) and requirements that apply
              (such as any minimum age, proficiency or fitness requirements for
              an Experience) and (iii) provide any other pertinent information

            </p>
            <p>
              7.1.2 You are solely responsible for setting a price (including
              any Taxes if applicable, or charges such as cleaning fees) for
              your Listing (“<strong>Listing Fee</strong>
              ”). Once a Guest requests a booking of your Listing, you may not
              request that the Guest pays a higher price than in the booking
              request.
            </p>
            <p>
              7.1.3 Any terms and conditions included in your Listing, in

              enables Partners to provide Listings to certain Guests, such as
              refugees or evacuees, for free. You acknowledge that if you choose
              to participate in the Open Homes Program, your ability to restrict
              your Listing to certain Guests, such as Guests with previous
              positive Reviews, may be limited.

              requirements, price and calendar availability, number and quality
              of Images, customer service and cancellation history, Reviews and
              Ratings, type of Partner Service, and/or ease of booking. More

              are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any
              deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including,
              but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will
              cover the actions or inactions of Guests (and the individuals the

              breach any agreements you have entered into with any third
              parties, such as homeowners association, condominium, or other

              (including having all required permits, licenses and

              omissions of any individuals who reside at or are otherwise
              present at the Accommodation at your request or invitation,

              Listing(s), and to bind the Partner and take certain actions in
              relation to the Listing(s) as permitted by the Partner, such as
              accepting booking requests, messaging and welcoming Guests, and
              updating the Listing Fee and calendar availability (collectively,
              “<strong>Co-Partner Services</strong>”). Any agreement formed
              between Partner and Co-Partner may not conflict with these Terms,

              other <a href="/help/topic/250/terms---policies">Policies</a>{" "}
              applicable to your Partner Service(s). Co-Partners may only act in

              Enjoythevi reserves the right, in our sole discretion, to limit
              the number of Co-Partners a Partner may invite for each Listing
              and to limit the number of Listings a Co-Partner may manage.

              7.4.2 Partners should exercise due diligence and care when

              remain solely responsible and liable for any and all Listings and
              Member Content published on the Enjoythevi Platform, including any
              Listing created by a Co-Partner on their behalf. Further, Partners
              remain responsible and liable for their own acts and omissions,
              including, but not limited to, conduct that causes harm or damage
              to the Co-Partner(s). Co-Partners remain responsible and liable
              for their own acts and omissions when engaging in their roles and
              responsibilities as a Co-Partner, including, but not limited to,
              conduct that causes harm or damage to the Partner. In addition,
              both Partner and Co-Partner are jointly responsible and severally
              liable for third party claims, including Guest claims, arising
              from the acts and omissions of the other person as related to
              Partnering activities, communications with Guests, and the
              provision of any Co-Partner Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              7.4.3 Unless agreed otherwise by Partner and Co-Partner, Partner
              and Co-Partner may terminate the Co-Partner agreement at any time.
              In addition, both Partner and Co-Partner acknowledge that their
              Co-Partnering relationship will terminate in the event that
              Enjoythevi (i) terminates the Co-Partner service or (ii)
              terminates either party’s participation in the Co-Partner service.
              When the Co-Partner agreement is terminated, the Partner will
              remain responsible for all of the Co-Partner’s actions prior to
              the termination, including the responsibility to fulfill any
              pending or future bookings initiated prior to the termination.
              When a Member is removed as a Co-Partner, that Member will no
              longer have access to any Partner or Guest information related to
              the applicable Partner’s Listing(s).{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              7.4.4 As a Co-Partner, you will not be reviewed by Guests, meaning
              that your Co-Partner activities will not affect your Reviews or
              Ratings for other Listings for which you are a Partner. Instead,
              the Partner of such Listing(s) will be reviewed by Guests
              (including potentially on the basis of the Co-Partner’s conduct
              and performance). Partners acknowledge that Reviews and Ratings
              from Guests for their Listing(s) may be impacted by a Co-Partner’s
              conduct and performance.

              8.1.3 If you book a Partner Service on behalf of additional
              guests, you are required to ensure that every additional guest
              meets any requirements set by the Partner, and is made aware of
              and agrees to these Terms and any terms and conditions, rules and
              restrictions set by the Partner. If you are booking for an
              additional guest who is a minor, you represent and warrant that
              you are legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor. Minors
              may only participate in an Experience, Event or other Partner

              8.1.4 Enjoythevi may enable a Guest who is booking a Listing on
              behalf of one or more additional guests (the “

              ”) to split the payment of the Total Fees for an eligible booking
              on a pro-rata basis between the Organizer and at least one other

              ”) (the “<strong>Group Payment Service</strong>”). In order to
              participate in the Group Payment Service, each Co-Payer must have
              or register an Enjoythevi Account prior to making a payment. All
              payments via the Group Payment Service are handled by Enjoythevi

            <h5>8.2 Booking Accommodations</h5>
            <p>
              8.2.1 You understand that a confirmed booking of an Accommodation
              (“<strong>Accommodation Booking</strong>”) is a limited license
              granted to you by the Partner to enter, occupy and use the
              Accommodation for the duration of your stay, during which time the
              Partner (only where and to the extent permitted by applicable law)
              retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation, in accordance
              with your agreement with the Partner.
            </p>
            <p>
              8.2.2 You agree to leave the Accommodation no later than the
              checkout time that the Partner specifies in the Listing or such
              other time as mutually agreed upon between you and the Partner. If
              you stay past the agreed upon checkout time without the Partner's
              consent (“
              <strong>Overstay</strong>”), you no longer have a license to stay
              in the Accommodation and the Partner is entitled to make you leave
              in a manner consistent with applicable law. In addition, you agree
              to pay, if requested by the Partner, for each twenty-four (24)
              hour period (or any portion thereof) that you Overstay, an
              additional nightly fee of up to two (2) times the average nightly
              Listing Fee originally paid by you to cover the inconvenience
              suffered by the Partner, plus all applicable Guest Fees, Taxes,
              and any legal expenses incurred by the Partner to make you leave
              (collectively, "<strong>Overstay Fees</strong>"). Overstay Fees
              for late checkouts on the checkout date that do not impact
              upcoming bookings may be limited to the additional costs incurred
              by the Partner as a result of such Overstay. If you Overstay at an
              Accommodation, you authorize Enjoythevi (via Enjoythevi Payments)
              to charge you to collect Overstay Fees. A Security Deposit, if
              required by a Partner, may be applied to any Overstay Fees due for
              a Guest’s Overstay.

              ensure you (and any additional guests you are booking for) meet
              any minimum age, proficiency, fitness or other requirements which
              the Partner has specified in their Listing. At your sole
              discretion you may want to inform the Partner of any medical or
              physical conditions, or other circumstances that may impact your
              and any additional guest’s ability to participate in any
              Experience, Event or other Partner Service. In addition, certain
              laws, like the minimum legal drinking age in the location of the
              Experience, Event or other Partner Service, may also apply. You
              are responsible for identifying, understanding, and complying with
              all laws, rules and regulations that apply to your participation
              in an Experience, Event or other Partner Service.

            <p>
              8.3.3 You may not bring any additional individuals to an

              from or to Guests or Partners to the smallest unit supported by a
              given currency (i.e., U.S. cents, Euro cents or other supported
              currencies). Where Enjoythevi’s third-party payment services
              provider does not support payments in the smaller unit supported
              by a given currency, Enjoythevi may, in its sole discretion, round
              up or round down the displayed amounts that are payable from or to
              Guests or Partners to the nearest whole functional base unit in
              which the currency is denominated (i.e. to the nearest dollar,
              Euro or other supported currency); for example, Enjoythevi may
              round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and round down an amount
              of $101.49 to $101.00.

            <p>
              13.1 As a Partner you are solely responsible for determining your
              obligations to report, collect, remit or include in your Listing
              Fees any applicable VAT or other indirect sales taxes, occupancy
              tax, tourist or other visitor taxes or income taxes ("
              <strong>Taxes</strong>").
            </p>
            <p>
              13.2 Tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate Tax
              information from Partners, or to withhold Taxes from payouts to
              Partners, or both. If a Partner fails to provide us with the
              required documentation under applicable law (e.g., a tax number)
              that we determine to be sufficient to alleviate our obligation (if
              any) to withhold Taxes from payouts to you, we reserve the right
              to withhold payouts up to the tax-relevant amount as required by
              law, until resolution.
            </p>
            <p>
              13.3 You understand that any appropriate governmental agency,
              department and/or authority ("<strong>Tax Authority</strong>")
              where your Accommodation is located may require Taxes to be
              collected from Guests or Partners on Listing Fees, and to be
              remitted to the respective Tax Authority. The laws in
              jurisdictions may vary, but these Taxes may be required to be
              collected and remitted as a percentage of the Listing Fees set by
              Partners, a set amount per day, or other variations, and are
              sometimes called "transient occupancy taxes," "hotel taxes,"
              "lodging taxes," "city taxes," "room taxes" or "tourist taxes" ("
              <strong>Occupancy Taxes</strong>
              ").
            </p>
            <p>
              13.4 In certain jurisdictions, Enjoythevi may decide in its sole
              discretion to facilitate collection and remittance of Occupancy
              Taxes from or on behalf of Guests or Partners, in accordance with
              these Terms ("
              <strong>Collection and Remittance</strong>") if such jurisdiction
              asserts Enjoythevi or Partners have an Occupancy Tax collection
              and remittance obligation. In any jurisdiction in which we decide
              to facilitate direct Collection and Remittance, you hereby
              instruct and authorize Enjoythevi (via Enjoythevi Payments) to
              collect Occupancy Taxes from Guests on the Partner's behalf at the
              time Listing Fees are collected, and to remit such Occupancy Taxes
              to the Tax Authority. In other jurisdictions Enjoythevi may decide
              in its sole discretion to collect Occupancy Taxes and remit such
              Taxes to eligible and qualifying Partners, based on tax
              information supplied by the Partner, for ultimate reporting and
              remittance by such Partner to the Tax Authority (“
              <strong>Pass-Through Tax Feature</strong>”). Such Partners using
              the Pass-Through Tax Feature will be solely responsible for
              informing Enjoythevi about the correct Occupancy Tax amount to be
              collected from the Guest in accordance with applicable law and
              directly remitting the Occupancy Taxes to the relevant Tax
              Authority. Enjoythevi does not assume any liability for the
              failure of a participating Partner to comply with any applicable
              tax reporting or remittance obligations. The amount of Occupancy
              Taxes, if any, collected and remitted by Enjoythevi will be
              visible to and separately stated to both Guests and Partners on
              their respective transaction documents. Where Enjoythevi is
              facilitating Collection and Remittance, Partners are not permitted
              to collect any Occupancy Taxes being collected by Enjoythevi
              relating to their Accommodations in that jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p>
              13.5 You agree that any claim or cause of action relating to
              Enjoythevi's facilitation of Collection and Remittance of
              Occupancy Taxes shall not extend to any supplier or vendor that
              may be used by Enjoythevi in connection with facilitation of
              Collection and Remittance, if any. Guests and Partners agree that
              we may seek additional amounts from you in the event that the
              Taxes collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully
              discharge your obligations to the Tax Authority, and agree that
              your sole remedy for Occupancy Taxes collected is a refund of
              Occupancy Taxes collected by Enjoythevi from the applicable Tax
              Authority in accordance with applicable procedures set by that Tax
              Authority.
            </p>
            <p>
              13.6 Enjoythevi reserves the right, with prior notice to Partners,
              to cease the Collection and Remittance in any jurisdiction for any
              reason at which point Partners and Guests are once again solely
              responsible and liable for the collection and/or remittance of any
              and all Occupancy Taxes that may apply to Accommodations in that
              jurisdiction.

              is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute
              resolution process. To that end, these Terms provide for a
              two-part process for individuals to whom Section 19.1 applies: (1)
              an informal negotiation directly with Enjoythevi’s customer
              service team, and (2) a binding arbitration administered by the
              American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) using
              its specially designed Consumer Arbitration Rules (as modified by
              this Section 19 and except as provided in Section 19.6).
              Specifically, the Consumer Arbitration Rules provide:

            <ul>
              <li>
                Claims can be filed with AAA online (

              <li>
                Arbitrators must disclose any bias, interest in the result of

              <li>
                Parties retain the right to seek relief in small claims court

                The consumer gets to elect the hearing location and can elect to

                under $25,000, by the submission of documents;
              </li>
              <li>
                The arbitrator can grant any remedy that the parties could have
                received in court to resolve the party’s individual claim.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              19.3 <em>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification</em>.
              Prior to initiating an arbitration, you and Enjoythevi each agree
              to notify the other party of the dispute and attempt to negotiate
              an informal resolution to it first. We will contact you at the
              email address you have provided to us; you can contact
              Enjoythevi’s customer service team by emailing us. If after a good
              faith effort to negotiate one of us feels the dispute has not and
              cannot be resolved informally, the party intending to pursue
              arbitration agrees to notify the other party via email prior to
              initiating the arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a
              claim must be filed with the AAA and the written Demand for
              Arbitration (available at{" "}
              <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Demand%20for%20Arbitration%20Consumer%20Arbitration%20Rules.pdf">

            <p>
              <strong>
                19.4 <em>Agreement to Arbitrate</em>. You and Enjoythevi
                mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising
                out of or relating to these Terms or the applicability, breach,
                termination, validity, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or
                to the use of the Enjoythevi Platform, the Partner Services, the
                Group Payment Service, or the Collective Content (collectively,
                “Disputes”) will be settled by binding individual arbitration
                (the “Arbitration Agreement”). If there is a dispute about
                whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to
                our Dispute, you and Enjoythevi agree that the arbitrator will
                decide that issue.

            <p>
              19.5 <em>Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement</em>. You and
              Enjoythevi each agree that the following claims are exceptions to
              the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial
              proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) Any claim
              related to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or
              violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets,
              patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) Any claim
              seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances
              (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking,
              cyber-attack).
            </p>
            <p>
              19.6 <em>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</em>. This
              Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate
              commerce and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the
              interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration
              will be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer
              Arbitration Rules and/or other AAA arbitration rules determined to
              be applicable by the AAA (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>“) then
              in effect, except as modified here. The AAA Rules are available at{" "}
              <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a> or by calling the
              AAA at 1–800–778–7879.

              19.7{" "}
              <em>Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location</em>.
              In order to make the arbitration most convenient to you,
              Enjoythevi agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be
              conducted, at your option, (a) in the county where you reside; (b)
              in San Francisco County; (c) in any other location to which you
              and Enjoythevi both agree; (d) via phone or video conference; or
              (e) for any claim or counterclaim under $25,000, by solely the
              submission of documents to the arbitrator.
            </p>
            <p>
              19.8{" "}
              <em>Modification of AAA Rules - Attorney’s Fees and Costs</em>.
              You and Enjoythevi agree that Enjoythevi will be responsible for
              payment of the balance of any initial filing fee under the AAA
              Rules in excess of $200 for claims of $75,000 or less. You may be
              entitled to seek an award of attorney fees and expenses if you
              prevail in arbitration, to the extent provided under applicable
              law and the AAA rules. Unless the arbitrator determines that your
              claim was frivolous or filed for the purpose of harassment,
              Enjoythevi agrees it will not seek, and hereby waives all rights
              it may have under applicable law or the AAA Rules, to recover
              attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.
            </p>
            <p>
              19.9 <em>Arbitrator’s Decision</em>. The arbitrator’s decision
              will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the
              arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may
              be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction. The arbitrator
              may award declaratory or injunctive relief only on an individual
              basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted
              by the claimant’s individual claim.

                You and Enjoythevi acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest
                extent permitted by law, we are each waiving the right to
                participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported
                class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney
                general action, or any other representative proceeding as to all
                Disputes. Further, unless you and Enjoythevi both otherwise
                agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than
                one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form
                of any class or representative proceeding. If the “class action
                lawsuit” waiver or the “class-wide arbitration” waiver in this
                Section 19.11 is held unenforceable with respect to any Dispute,
                then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement will be deemed
                void with respect to such Dispute and the Dispute must proceed
                in court. If the “private attorney general action” waiver or the
                “representative proceeding” waiver in this Section 19.11 is held
                unenforceable with respect to any Dispute, those waivers may be
                severed from this Arbitration Agreement and you and Enjoythevi
                agree that any private attorney general claims and
                representative claims in the Dispute will be severed and stayed,
                pending the resolution of any arbitrable claims in the Dispute
                in individual arbitration.

            <p>
              19.12 <em>Severability</em>. Except as provided in Section 19.11,
              in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is
              deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed
              and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full

              Section 19 (“Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement”) after
              the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent
              changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending
              us written notice (including by email) within thirty (30) days of
              the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last
              Updated” date above or in the date of Enjoythevi’s email to you
              notifying you of such change. Rejecting a new change, however,
              does not revoke or alter your prior consent to any earlier
              agreements to arbitrate any Dispute between you and Enjoythevi (or
              your prior consent to any subsequent changes thereto), which will
              remain in effect and enforceable as to any Dispute between you and
              Enjoythevi.

              19.14 <em>Survival</em>. Except as provided in Section 19.12 and

              termination of these Terms and will continue to apply even if you

            <p>
              21.1 If your country of residence or establishment is the United
              States, these Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the
              laws of the State of California and the United States of America,
              without regard to conflict-of-law provisions. Judicial proceedings
              (other than small claims actions) that are excluded from the
              Arbitration Agreement in Section 19 must be brought in state or
              federal court in San Francisco, California, unless we both agree
              to some other location. You and we both consent to venue and
              personal jurisdiction in San Francisco, California.
            </p>
            <p>
              21.2 If your country of residence or establishment is China these
              Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of China (“
              <strong>China Laws</strong>”). Any dispute arising from or in
              connection with this Agreement shall be submitted to the China
              International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC)
              for arbitration in Beijing which shall be conducted in accordance
              with CIETAC’s arbitration rules in effect at the time of applying
              for arbitration, provided that this section shall not be construed
              to limit any rights which Enjoythevi may have to apply to any
              court of competent jurisdiction for an order requiring you to
              perform or be prohibited from performing certain acts and other
              provisional relief permitted under China Laws or any other laws
              that may apply to you. The arbitration proceedings shall be
              conducted in English. The arbitral award rendered is final and
              binding upon both parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              21.3 If your country of residence or establishment is outside of
              the United States and China, these Terms will be interpreted in
              accordance with Irish law. The application of the United Nations
              Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG)
              is excluded. The choice of law does not impact your rights as a
              consumer according to the consumer protection regulations of your
              country of residence. If you are acting as a consumer, you agree
              to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Irish courts.
              Judicial proceedings that you are able to bring against us arising
              from or in connection with these Terms may only be brought in a
              court located in Ireland or a court with jurisdiction in your
              place of residence. If Enjoythevi wishes to enforce any of its
              rights against you as a consumer, we may do so only in the courts
              of the jurisdiction in which you are a resident. If you are acting
              as a business, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
              of the Irish courts.

              22.1 Except as they may be supplemented by additional terms and
              conditions, policies, guidelines or standards, these Terms
              constitute the entire Agreement between Enjoythevi and you
              pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersede any and all
              prior oral or written understandings or agreements between
              Enjoythevi and you in relation to the access to and use of the
              Enjoythevi Platform.

            <p>
              22.2 No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency
              relationship exists between you and Enjoythevi as a result of this
              Agreement or your use of the Enjoythevi Platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              22.3 These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights

            </p>
            <p>
              22.4 If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or
              unenforceable, such provision will be struck and will not affect
              the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.
            </p>

              22.5 Enjoythevi’s failure to enforce any right or provision in
              these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or
              provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing.
              Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by
              either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be
              without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or
              otherwise permitted under law.

              <a name="eusec202002-1"></a>1. Scope of Enjoythevi Services
            </h4>
            <p>
              1.1 The Enjoythevi Platform is an online marketplace that enables
              registered users (“<strong>Members</strong>”) and certain third
              parties who offer services (Members and third parties who offer
              services are “<strong>Partners</strong>” and the services they
              offer are “<strong>Partner Services</strong>”) to publish such
              Partner Services on the Enjoythevi Platform (“
              <strong>Listings</strong>”) and to communicate and transact
              directly with Members that are seeking to book such Partner
              Services (Members using Partner Services are “
              <strong>Guests</strong>”). Partner Services may include the
              offering of vacation or other properties for use ("
              <strong>Accommodations</strong>"), single or multi-day activities
              in various categories (“
              <strong>Experiences</strong>”), access to unique events and
              locations (“<strong>Events</strong>”), and a variety of other
              travel and non-travel related services.
            </p>
            <p>
              1.2 As the provider of the Enjoythevi Platform, Enjoythevi does
              not own, create, sell, resell, provide, control, manage, offer,
              deliver, or supply any Listings or Partner Services, nor is
              Enjoythevi an organiser or retailer of travel packages under
              Directive (EU) 2015/2302. Partners alone are responsible for their
              Listings and Partner Services. When Members make or accept a
              booking, they are entering into a contract directly with each
              other. Enjoythevi is not and does not become a party to or other
              participant in any contractual relationship between Members, nor
              is Enjoythevi a real estate broker or insurer. Enjoythevi is not
              acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as
              specified in the{" "}
              <a href="/terms/payments-terms">Payments Terms</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              1.3 While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes,
              Enjoythevi has no control over and does not guarantee (i) the
              existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of any
              Listings or Partner Services, (ii) the truth or accuracy of any
              Listing descriptions, Ratings, Reviews, or other Member Content
              (as defined below), or (iii) the performance or conduct of any
              Member or third party. Enjoythevi does not endorse any Member,
              Listing or Partner Services. Any references to a Member being "
              <a href="/help/article/336/what-are-profile-verifications-and-how-do-i-get-them">
                verified
              </a>
              " (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has
              completed a relevant verification or identification process and
              nothing else. Any such description is not an endorsement,
              certification or guarantee by Enjoythevi about any Member,
              including of the Member's identity or background or whether the
              Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. You should always
              exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to stay in
              an Accommodation, participate in an Experience or Event or use
              other Partner Services, accept a booking request from a Guest, or
              communicate and interact with other Members, whether online or in
              person. Verified Images (as defined below) are intended only to
              indicate a photographic representation of a Listing at the time
              the photograph was taken, and are therefore not an endorsement by
              Enjoythevi of any Partner or Listing.
            </p>
            <p>
              1.4 If you choose to use the Enjoythevi Platform as a Partner or
              Co-Partner (as defined below), your relationship with Enjoythevi
              is limited to being an independent, third-party contractor, and
              not an employee, agent, joint venturer or partner of Enjoythevi
              for any reason, and you act exclusively on your own behalf and for
              your own benefit, and not on behalf, or for the benefit, of
              Enjoythevi. Enjoythevi does not, and shall not be deemed to,
              direct or control you generally or in your performance under these
              Terms specifically, including in connection with your provision of
              the Partner Services. You acknowledge that you have complete
              discretion whether to list Partner Services or otherwise engage in
              other business or employment activities.
            </p>
            <p>
              1.5 To promote the Enjoythevi Platform and to increase the
              exposure of Listings to potential Guests, Listings and other
              Member Content may be displayed on other websites, in
              applications, within emails, and in online and offline
              advertisements in accordance with Section 5. To assist Members who
              speak different languages, Enjoythevi may make automated tools
              available to enable Members to translate Listings and other Member
              Content, in whole or in part, into other languages. Members are
              free to use these tools at their own discretion. Enjoythevi cannot
              guarantee the accuracy or quality of such translations and Members
              are responsible for reviewing and verifying the accuracy of such
              translations.
            </p>
            <p>
              1.6 The Enjoythevi Platform may contain links to third-party
              websites or resources (“<strong>Third-Party Services</strong>
              ”). Such Third-Party Services may be subject to different terms
              and conditions and privacy practices. Enjoythevi is not
              responsible or liable for the availability or accuracy of such
              Third-Party Services, or the content, products, or services
              available from such Third-Party Services. Links to such
              Third-Party Services are not an endorsement by Enjoythevi of such
              Third-Party Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              1.7 Enjoythevi is not responsible for outages or disruptions of
              the Internet and telecommunications infrastructure which are
              beyond our control and can lead to interruptions in the
              availability of the Enjoythevi Platform. Enjoythevi may,
              temporarily and under consideration of the Members’ legitimate
              interests (e.g. by providing prior notice), restrict the
              availability of the Enjoythevi Platform or certain areas or
              features thereof, if this is necessary in view of capacity limits,
              the security or integrity of our servers, or to carry out
              maintenance measures that ensure the proper or improved
              functioning of the Enjoythevi Platform. Section 17 (Liability)
              remains unaffected. Enjoythevi may improve, enhance and modify the
              Enjoythevi Platform and introduce new Enjoythevi Services from
              time to time. Enjoythevi will provide notice to Members of any
              changes to the Enjoythevi Platform, unless such changes are of
              minor nature without having a material effect on the parties’
              contractual obligations.

            <p>
              2.1 In order to access and use the Enjoythevi Platform or register
              an Enjoythevi Account you must be an individual at least 18 years
              old or a duly organized, validly existing business, organization
              or other legal entity in good standing under the laws of the

              contracts.
            </p>
            <p>
              2.2 You will comply with any applicable export control laws in
              your local jurisdiction. You also represent and warrant that (i)
              neither you nor your Partner Service(s) are located or take place
              in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that

              supporting" country, and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S.
              Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              2.3 Enjoythevi may make access to and use of the Enjoythevi
              Platform, or certain areas or features of the Enjoythevi Platform,
              subject to certain conditions or requirements, such as completing
              a verification process, meeting specific quality or eligibility
              criteria, meeting Ratings or Reviews thresholds, or a Member’s
              booking and cancellation history.
            </p>
            <p>
              2.4 User verification on the Internet is difficult and we do not
              assume any responsibility for the confirmation of any Member’s
              identity. Notwithstanding the above, for transparency and fraud
              prevention purposes, and as permitted by applicable laws, we may,
              but have no obligation to (i) ask Members to provide a form of
              government identification or other information or undertake
              additional checks designed to help verify the identities or
              backgrounds of Members, (ii) screen Members against third party
              databases or other sources and request reports from service
              providers, and (iii) where we have sufficient information to
              identify a Member, obtain reports from public records of criminal
              convictions or sex offender registrations or an equivalent version
              of background or registered sex offender checks in your local
              jurisdiction (if available).
            </p>
            <p>
              2.5 The access to or use of certain areas and features of the
              Enjoythevi Platform may be subject to separate policies, standards
              or guidelines, or may require that you accept additional terms and
              conditions,before you can access the relevant areas or features of
              the Enjoythevi Platform. If there is a conflict between these
              Terms and terms and conditions applicable to a specific area or
              feature of the Enjoythevi Platform, the latter terms and
              conditions will take precedence with respect to your access to or
              use of that area or feature, unless specified otherwise in the
              latter terms and conditions.

            <p>
              Enjoythevi reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time in
              accordance with this provision. If we make changes to these Terms,
              we will post the revised Terms on the Enjoythevi Platform and
              update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms. We will
              also provide you with notice of the modifications by email at
              least thirty (30) days before the date they become effective. If
              you disagree with the revised Terms, you may terminate this
              Agreement with immediate effect. We will inform you about your
              right to terminate the Agreement in the notification email. If you
              do not terminate your Agreement before the date the revised Terms
              become effective, your continued access to or use of the
              Enjoythevi Platform will constitute acceptance of the revised
              Terms.

            </h4>
            <p>

              ") to access and use certain features of the Enjoythevi Platform,
              such as publishing or booking a Listing. If you are registering an
              Enjoythevi Account for a business, organization or other legal
              entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to
              legally bind that entity and grant us all permissions and licenses
              provided in these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.2 You can register an Enjoythevi Account using an email address
              and creating a password, or through your account with certain
              third-party social networking services, such as Facebook or Google
              ("<strong>SNS Account</strong>"). You have the ability to disable
              the connection between your Enjoythevi Account and your SNS
              Account at any time, by accessing the "Settings" section of the
              Enjoythevi Platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.3 You must provide accurate, current and complete information
              during the registration process and keep your Enjoythevi Account
              and public Enjoythevi Account profile page information up-to-date
              at all times.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.4 You may not register more than one (1) Enjoythevi Account
              unless Enjoythevi authorizes you to do so. You may not assign or
              otherwise transfer your Enjoythevi Account to another party.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.5 You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and
              security of your Enjoythevi Account credentials and may not
              disclose your credentials to any third party. You must immediately
              notify Enjoythevi if you know or have any reason to suspect that
              your credentials have been lost, stolen, misappropriated, or
              otherwise compromised or in case of any actual or suspected
              unauthorized use of your Enjoythevi Account. You are liable for
              any and all activities conducted through your Enjoythevi Account,
              unless such activities are not authorized by you and you are not
              otherwise negligent (such as failing to report the unauthorized
              use or loss of your credentials).
            </p>
            <p>
              4.6 Enjoythevi may enable features that allow you to authorize
              other Members or certain third parties to take certain actions
              that affect your Enjoythevi Account. For example, we may enable
              Members to link their Enjoythevi Accounts to businesses and take
              actions for those businesses, we may enable eligible Members or
              certain third parties to book Listings on behalf of other Members,
              or we may enable Partners to add other Members as Co-Partners (as
              defined below) to help manage their Listings. These features do
              not require that you share your credentials with any other person.
              No third party is authorized by Enjoythevi to ask for your
              credentials, and you shall not request the credentials of another
              Member.

              or through the Enjoythevi Platform if they no longer accurately
              represent your Listing, if you stop Partnering the Partner Service
              featured, or if your Enjoythevi Account is terminated or suspended

              exclusive owner of all Member Content that you make available on
              or through the Enjoythevi Platform or you have all rights,

              (such as any minimum age, proficiency or fitness requirements for
              an Experience) and (iii) provide any other pertinent information

              your Listing (“<strong>Listing Fee</strong>
              ”). Once a Guest requests a booking of your Listing, you may not
              request that the Guest pays a higher price than in the booking
              request.
            </p>
            <p>
              7.1.3 Any terms and conditions included in your Listing, in

              insurance for their Partner Services. Please review any respective

              deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including,

              Listing(s), and to bind the Partner and take certain actions in
              relation to the Listing(s) as permitted by the Partner, such as
              accepting booking requests, messaging and welcoming Guests, and
              updating the Listing Fee and calendar availability (collectively,

              Enjoythevi reserves the right, in our sole discretion, to limit

              both Partner and Co-Partner are jointly responsible and severally
              liable for third party claims, including Guest claims, arising
              from the acts and omissions of the other person as related to
              Partnering activities, communications with Guests, and the
              provision of any Co-Partner Services.

              7.4.3 Unless agreed otherwise by Partner and Co-Partner, Partner
              and Co-Partner may terminate the Co-Partner agreement at any time.
              In addition, both Partner and Co-Partner acknowledge that their
              Co-Partnering relationship will terminate in the event that
              Enjoythevi (i) terminates the Co-Partner service or (ii)
              terminates either party’s participation in the Co-Partner service.
              When the Co-Partner agreement is terminated, the Partner will
              remain responsible for all of the Co-Partner’s actions prior to
              the termination, including the responsibility to fulfill any
              pending or future bookings initiated prior to the termination,
              except in the event of gross misconduct or malicious behavior of
              the Co-Partner. When a Member is removed as a Co-Partner, that
              Member will no longer have access to any Partner or Guest
              information related to the applicable Partner’s Listing(s).

              7.4.4 As a Co-Partner, you will not be reviewed by Guests, meaning
              that your Co-Partner activities will not affect your Reviews or
              Ratings for other Listings for which you are a Partner. Instead,
              the Partner of such Listing(s) will be reviewed by Guests
              (including potentially on the basis of the Co-Partner’s conduct
              and performance). Partners acknowledge that Reviews and Ratings
              from Guests for their Listing(s) may be impacted by a Co-Partner’s
              conduct and performance.

              8.1.1 Subject to meeting any requirements (such as completing any
              verification processes) set by Enjoythevi and/or the Partner, you
              can book a Listing available on the Enjoythevi Platform by
              following the respective booking process. All applicable fees,
              including the Listing Fee, Security Deposit (if applicable), Guest
              Fee and any applicable Taxes (collectively, “
              <strong>Total Fees</strong>

              to pay the Total Fees for any booking requested in connection with
              your Enjoythevi Account.
            </p>
            <p>
              8.1.2 Upon receipt of a booking confirmation from Enjoythevi, a

              apply, including in particular the applicable cancellation policy
              and any rules and restrictions specified in the Listing.
              Enjoythevi Payments will collect the Total Fees at the time of the
              booking request or upon the Partner’s confirmation pursuant to the{" "}

            <p>
              8.1.3 If you book a Partner Service on behalf of additional

              meets any requirements set by the Partner, and is made aware of
              and agrees to these Terms and any terms and conditions, rules and
              restrictions set by the Partner. If you are booking for an
              additional guest who is a minor, you represent and warrant that
              you are legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor. Minors
              may only participate in an Experience, Event or other Partner
              Service if accompanied by an adult who is responsible for them.

            <p>
              8.1.4 Enjoythevi may enable a Guest who is booking a Listing on
              behalf of one or more additional guests (the “

              8.2.1 You understand that a confirmed booking of an Accommodation
              (“<strong>Accommodation Booking</strong>”) is a limited license
              granted to you by the Partner to enter, occupy and use the
              Accommodation for the duration of your stay, during which time the
              Partner (only where and to the extent permitted by applicable law)
              retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation, in accordance
              with your agreement with the Partner.
            </p>
            <p>
              8.2.2 You agree to leave the Accommodation no later than the
              checkout time that the Partner specifies in the Listing or such
              other time as mutually agreed upon between you and the Partner. If
              you stay past the agreed upon checkout time without the Partner's
              consent (“
              <strong>Overstay</strong>”), you no longer have a license to stay
              in the Accommodation and the Partner is entitled to make you leave
              in a manner consistent with applicable law.{" "}

              any minimum age, proficiency, fitness or other requirements which
              the Partner has specified in their Listing. At your sole

              and any additional guest’s ability to participate in any
              Experience, Event or other Partner Service. In addition, certain
              laws, like the minimum legal drinking age in the location of the

              carrying out a Partner Service that takes place primarily
              outdoors, Partners may cancel the Partner Service. Partners may
              also cancel the Partner Service if other conditions exist that

            </h4>
            <p>
              Enjoythevi generally supports payment amounts that are payable
              from or to Guests or Partners to the smallest unit supported by a
              given currency (i.e., U.S. cents, Euro cents or other supported
              currencies). Where Enjoythevi’s third-party payment services
              provider does not support payments in the smaller unit supported
              by a given currency, Enjoythevi may, in its sole discretion, round
              up or round down the displayed amounts that are payable from or to
              Guests or Partners to the nearest whole functional base unit in
              which the currency is denominated (i.e. to the nearest dollar,
              Euro or other supported currency); for example, Enjoythevi may
              round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and round down an amount
              of $101.49 to $101.00.

            </h4>
            <p>
              13.1 As a Partner you are solely responsible for determining your
              obligations to report, collect, remit or include in your Listing
              Fees any applicable VAT or other indirect sales taxes, occupancy
              tax, tourist or other visitor taxes or income taxes ("
              <strong>Taxes</strong>").
            </p>
            <p>
              13.2 Tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate Tax
              information from Partners, or to withhold Taxes from payouts to
              Partners, or both. If a Partner fails to provide us with the
              required documentation under applicable law (e.g. a tax number) to
              alleviate our obligation (if any) to withhold Taxes from payouts
              to you, we reserve the right to withhold payouts up to the
              tax-relevant amount as required by law until resolution.
            </p>
            <p>
              13.3 You understand that any appropriate governmental agency,
              department and/or authority ("<strong>Tax Authority</strong>")
              where your Accommodation is located may require Taxes to be
              collected from Guests or Partners on Listing Fees, and to be
              remitted to the respective Tax Authority. The laws in
              jurisdictions may vary, but these Taxes may be required to be
              collected and remitted as a percentage of the Listing Fees set by
              Partners, a set amount per day, or other variations, and are
              sometimes called "transient occupancy taxes," "hotel taxes,"
              "lodging taxes," "city taxes," "room taxes" or "tourist taxes" ("
              <strong>Occupancy Taxes</strong>
              ").
            </p>
            <p>
              13.4 In certain jurisdictions, Enjoythevi may decide in its sole
              discretion to facilitate collection and remittance of Occupancy
              Taxes from or on behalf of Guests or Partners, in accordance with
              these Terms ("
              <strong>Collection and Remittance</strong>") if such jurisdiction
              asserts Enjoythevi or Partners have an Occupancy Tax collection
              and remittance obligation. In any jurisdiction in which we decide
              to facilitate direct Collection and Remittance, you hereby
              instruct and authorize Enjoythevi (via Enjoythevi Payments) to
              collect Occupancy Taxes from Guests on the Partner's behalf at the
              time Listing Fees are collected, and to remit such Occupancy Taxes
              to the Tax Authority. In other jurisdictions Enjoythevi may decide
              in its sole discretion to collect Occupancy Taxes and remit such
              Taxes to eligible and qualifying Partners, based on tax
              information supplied by the Partner, for ultimate reporting and
              remittance by such Partner to the Tax Authority (“
              <strong>Pass-Through Tax Feature</strong>”). Such Partners using
              the Pass-Through Tax Feature will be solely responsible for
              informing Enjoythevi about the correct Occupancy Tax amount to be
              collected from the Guest in accordance with applicable law and
              directly remitting the Occupancy Taxes to the relevant Tax
              Authority. Enjoythevi does not assume any liability for the
              failure of a participating Partner to comply with any applicable
              tax reporting or remittance obligations.The amount of Occupancy
              Taxes, if any, collected and remitted by Enjoythevi will be
              visible to and separately stated to both Guests and Partners on
              their respective transaction documents. Where Enjoythevi is
              facilitating Collection and Remittance, Partners are not permitted
              to collect any Occupancy Taxes being collected by Enjoythevi
              relating to their Accommodations in that jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p>
              13.5 Guests and Partners agree that we may seek additional amounts
              from you in the event that the Taxes collected and/or remitted are
              insufficient to fully discharge your obligations to the Tax
              Authority, and agree that your sole remedy for Occupancy Taxes
              collected is a refund of Occupancy Taxes collected by Enjoythevi
              from the applicable Tax Authority in accordance with applicable
              procedures set by that Tax Authority.
            </p>
            <p>
              13.6 Enjoythevi reserves the right, with prior notice to Partners,
              to cease the Collection and Remittance in any jurisdiction for any
              reason at which point Partners and Guests are once again solely
              responsible and liable for the collection and/or remittance of any
              and all Occupancy Taxes that may apply to Accommodations in that
              jurisdiction.

              19.1 This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement shall apply
              if you bring any claim against Enjoythevi in the United States (to
              the extent not in conflict with Section 21).
            </p>
            <p>
              19.2 <em>Overview of Dispute Resolution Process</em>. Enjoythevi
              is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute
              resolution process. To that end, these Terms provide for a
              two-part process for individuals to whom Section 19.1 applies: (1)
              an informal negotiation directly with Enjoythevi’s customer
              service team, and (2) a binding arbitration administered by the
              American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) using
              its specially designed Consumer Arbitration Rules (as modified by
              this Section 19 and except as provided in Section 19.6).
              Specifically, the Consumer Arbitration Rules provide:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Claims can be filed with AAA online (
                <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>);
              </li>
              <li>
                Arbitrators must be neutral and no party may unilaterally select
                an arbitrator;
              </li>
              <li>
                Arbitrators must disclose any bias, interest in the result of
                the arbitration, or relationship with any party;
              </li>
              <li>
                Parties retain the right to seek relief in small claims court
                for certain claims, at their option;
              </li>
              <li>
                The initial filing fee for the consumer is capped at $200;
              </li>
              <li>
                The consumer gets to elect the hearing location and can elect to
                participate live, by phone, video conference, or, for claims
                under $25,000, by the submission of documents;
              </li>
              <li>
                The arbitrator can grant any remedy that the parties could have
                received in court to resolve the party’s individual claim.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              19.3 <em>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification</em>.
              Prior to initiating an arbitration, you and Enjoythevi each agree
              to notify the other party of the dispute and attempt to negotiate
              an informal resolution to it first. We will contact you at the
              email address you have provided to us; you can contact
              Enjoythevi’s customer service team by emailing us. If after a good
              faith effort to negotiate one of us feels the dispute has not and
              cannot be resolved informally, the party intending to pursue
              arbitration agrees to notify the other party via email prior to
              initiating the arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a
              claim must be filed with the AAA and the written Demand for
              Arbitration (available at{" "}
              <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Demand%20for%20Arbitration%20Consumer%20Arbitration%20Rules.pdf">

              </a>
              ) provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA Rules.

            <p>
              <strong>
                19.4 <em>Agreement to Arbitrate</em>. You and Enjoythevi
                mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising
                out of or relating to these Terms or the applicability, breach,
                termination, validity, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or
                to the use of the Enjoythevi Platform, the Partner Services, the
                Group Payment Service, or the Collective Content (collectively,
                “Disputes”) will be settled by binding individual arbitration
                (the “Arbitration Agreement”). If there is a dispute about
                whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to
                our Dispute, you and Enjoythevi agree that the arbitrator will
                decide that issue.

            </p>
            <p>
              19.5 <em>Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement</em>. You and
              Enjoythevi each agree that the following claims are exceptions to
              the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial
              proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) Any claim
              related to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or
              violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets,
              patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) Any claim
              seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances
              (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking,
              cyber-attack).
            </p>
            <p>
              19.6 <em>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</em>. This
              Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate
              commerce and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the
              interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration
              will be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer
              Arbitration Rules and/or other AAA arbitration rules determined to
              be applicable by the AAA (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>“) then
              in effect, except as modified here. The AAA Rules are available at{" "}
              <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a> or by calling the
              AAA at 1–800–778–7879.

              <em>Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location</em>.
              In order to make the arbitration most convenient to you,
              Enjoythevi agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be
              conducted, at your option, (a) in the county where you reside; (b)
              in San Francisco County; (c) in any other location to which you
              and Enjoythevi both agree; (d) via phone or video conference; or
              (e) for any claim or counterclaim under $25,000, by solely the
              submission of documents to the arbitrator.
            </p>
            <p>
              19.8{" "}
              <em>Modification of AAA Rules - Attorney’s Fees and Costs</em>.
              You and Enjoythevi agree that Enjoythevi will be responsible for
              payment of the balance of any initial filing fee under the AAA
              Rules in excess of $200 for claims of $75,000 or less. You may be
              entitled to seek an award of attorney fees and expenses if you
              prevail in arbitration, to the extent provided under applicable
              law and the AAA rules. Unless the arbitrator determines that your
              claim was frivolous or filed for the purpose of harassment,
              Enjoythevi agrees it will not seek, and hereby waives all rights
              it may have under applicable law or the AAA Rules, to recover
              attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.
            </p>
            <p>
              19.9 <em>Arbitrator’s Decision</em>. The arbitrator’s decision
              will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the
              arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may
              be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction. The arbitrator
              may award declaratory or injunctive relief only on an individual
              basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted
              by the claimant’s individual claim.

                19.10 <em>Jury Trial Waiver</em>. You and Enjoythevi acknowledge

                19.11 <em>No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings</em>.
                You and Enjoythevi acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest
                extent permitted by law, we are each waiving the right to
                participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported
                class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private
                attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding
                as to all Disputes. Further, unless you and Enjoythevi both
                otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate
                more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over
                any form of any class or representative proceeding. If the
                “class action lawsuit” waiver or the “class-wide arbitration”
                waiver in this Section 19.11 is held unenforceable with respect
                to any Dispute, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement
                will be deemed void with respect to such Dispute and the Dispute
                must proceed in court. If the “private attorney general action”
                waiver or the “representative proceeding” waiver in this Section
                19.11 is held unenforceable with respect to any Dispute, those
                waivers may be severed from this Arbitration Agreement and you
                and Enjoythevi agree that any private attorney general claims
                and representative claims in the Dispute will be severed and
                stayed, pending the resolution of any arbitrable claims in the
                Dispute in individual arbitration.

            </p>
            <p>
              19.12 <em>Severability</em>. Except as provided in Section 19.11,
              in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is
              deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed
              and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full
              force and effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              19.13 <em>Changes</em>. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
              3 (“Modification of these Terms”), if Enjoythevi changes this
              Section 19 (“Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement”) after
              the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent
              changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending
              us written notice (including by email) within thirty (30) days of

              Updated” date above or in the date of Enjoythevi’s email to you
              notifying you of such change. Rejecting a new change, however,
              does not revoke or alter your prior consent to any earlier
              agreements to arbitrate any Dispute between you and Enjoythevi (or
              your prior consent to any subsequent changes thereto), which will

            </h4>
            <p>
              These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with Irish
              law. If you are acting as a consumer and if mandatory statutory
              consumer protection regulations in your country of residence
              contain provisions that are more beneficial for you, such
              provisions shall apply irrespective of the choice of Irish law. As
              a consumer, you may bring any judicial proceedings relating to
              these Terms before the competent court of your place of residence
              or the competent court of Enjoythevi's place of business in
              Ireland. If Enjoythevi wishes to enforce any of its rights against
              you as a consumer, we may do so only in the courts of the
              jurisdiction in which you are a resident. If you are acting as a
              business, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
              Irish courts.

            <p>
              22.1 Except as they may be supplemented by additional terms and
              conditions, policies, guidelines or standards, these Terms
              constitute the entire Agreement between Enjoythevi and you
              pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersede any and all
              prior oral or written understandings or agreements between
              Enjoythevi and you in relation to the access to and use of the
              Enjoythevi Platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              22.2 No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency
              relationship exists between you and Enjoythevi as a result of this
              Agreement or your use of the Enjoythevi Platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              22.3 These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights
              or remedies upon any person other than the parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              22.4 If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or
              unenforceable, such provision will be struck and will not affect
              the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              22.5 Enjoythevi’s failure to enforce any right or provision in
              these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or
              provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing.
              Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by
              either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be
              without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or
              otherwise permitted under law.

              transfer or delegate this Agreement and any rights and obligations
              hereunder, at its sole discretion, with 30 days prior notice. Your
              right to terminate this Agreement at any time remains unaffected.

              notifications via electronic means in lieu of a written statement,
              satisfies Enjoythevi’s obligations under Article 59 Paragraph 1 of
              the Japanese Housing Accommodation Business Act.
